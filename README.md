# Racecar code for FDM Hackathon
## Background
This code was written to control a robot using two BBC Micro bits. One is controlling the robot, and one is the remote to send signals to the other.
## How to drive
The robot is driving at full forward speed by default. To steer, you press a button on the remote to slow down the repective wheel (Left or right).
